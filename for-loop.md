Certainly! Let's go through the process for each iteration of the outer loop when `h = 5` and `w = 5`. We will observe how the rectangle is constructed line by line.

Iteration 1:
- `i = 0`
- The inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = w - 1` (from 0 to 4).
- Since `i` is equal to 0, the condition `i == 0` is true.
- Therefore, an asterisk (`*`) is printed using `printf("*")`.
- The inner loop continues for `j = 1`, `j = 2`, `j = 3`, and `j = 4`, and for each iteration, spaces are printed because the condition for asterisk printing is not satisfied.
- After the inner loop finishes, a newline character (`\n`) is printed using `printf("\n")` to move to the next line.

The output after the first iteration of the outer loop:
```
*****
```

Iteration 2:
- `i = 1`
- The inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = w - 1` (from 0 to 4).
- Since `i` is not equal to 0 or `h - 1`, the condition `i == 0 || i == h-1` is false for `i = 1`.
- Therefore, spaces are printed for each iteration of the inner loop because the condition for asterisk printing is not satisfied.
- After the inner loop finishes, a newline character (`\n`) is printed using `printf("\n")` to move to the next line.

The output after the second iteration of the outer loop:
```
*****
*   *
```

Iteration 3:
- `i = 2`
- The inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = w - 1` (from 0 to 4).
- Since `i` is not equal to 0 or `h - 1`, the condition `i == 0 || i == h-1` is false for `i = 2`.
- Therefore, spaces are printed for each iteration of the inner loop because the condition for asterisk printing is not satisfied.
- After the inner loop finishes, a newline character (`\n`) is printed using `printf("\n")` to move to the next line.

The output after the third iteration of the outer loop:
```
*****
*   *
*   *
```

Iteration 4:
- `i = 3`
- The inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = w - 1` (from 0 to 4).
- Since `i` is not equal to 0 or `h - 1`, the condition `i == 0 || i == h-1` is false for `i = 3`.
- Therefore, spaces are printed for each iteration of the inner loop because the condition for asterisk printing is not satisfied.
- After the inner loop finishes, a newline character (`\n`) is printed using `printf("\n")` to move to the next line.

The output after the fourth iteration of the outer loop:
```
*****
*   *
*   *
*   *
```

Iteration 5:
- `i = 4`
- The inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = w - 1` (from 0 to 4).
- Since `i` is equal to `h - 1`, the condition `i == 0 || i == h-1` is true.
- Therefore, an asterisk (`*`)

 is printed using `printf("*")`.
- The inner loop continues for `j = 1`, `j = 2`, `j = 3`, and `j = 4`, and for each iteration, spaces are printed because the condition for asterisk printing is not satisfied.
- After the inner loop finishes, a newline character (`\n`) is printed using `printf("\n")` to move to the next line.

The final output after all iterations of the outer loop:
```
*****
*   *
*   *
*   *

```

This is the resulting rectangle printed with asterisks (`*`) on the boundary and spaces (` `) inside.
